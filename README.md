# Block Concurrent Sessions Quiz Access Rule

A Moodle quiz access rule plugin that prevents students from continuing a quiz attempt across multiple sessions or devices, ensuring exam integrity by blocking concurrent connections.

## Requirements

*   **Moodle 5.0 or later**
*   Tested and confirmed working with Moodle 5.0 and 5.1

## Installation

1.  Copy the `oneconnection` folder into your Moodle's `mod/quiz/accessrule/` directory.
2.  Log in to your Moodle site as an administrator and visit **Site administration > Notifications** to complete the installation.
3.  (Optional) Configure default settings at **Site administration > Plugins > Activity modules > Quiz > Quiz access rule: Block concurrent connections**.

## Overview

This plugin prevents students from accessing the same quiz attempt from multiple devices, browsers, or locations simultaneously. When a student starts a quiz attempt, their session information (Moodle session, user-agent, IP address) is securely recorded. Any subsequent attempt to access that same quiz from a different connection will be blocked.

**Use cases:**
- **Digital exams:** Prevents ghostwriting and unauthorized assistance during online exams
- **Proctored assessments:** Ensures students remain on their original device throughout the test
- **High-stakes testing:** Provides an additional security layer for important examinations

## Features

### Core Functionality
- **Session binding:** Locks quiz attempts to the original device/browser session
- **Multi-factor detection:** Validates Moodle session, user-agent, and IP address
- **Secure hashing:** Uses SHA-256 with salt for session fingerprinting

### Management & Monitoring
- **Dedicated management page:** "Allow connection changes" page accessible from the Results tab
- **Bulk actions:** Allow connection changes for multiple students simultaneously
- **Advanced filtering:** Filter by enrolled users, attempt status, and user groups
- **Sorting & pagination:** Sort by any column, use initials bar for quick navigation
- **Comprehensive audit log:** All connection changes are permanently logged with timestamp and authorizing user
- **Export functionality:** Export table data as CSV or Excel for external analysis

### Access Control
- **Fine-grained capabilities:**
  - `quizaccess/oneconnection:allowchange` - Allow teachers to unlock attempts
  - `quizaccess/oneconnection:editenabled` - Control who can enable/disable the rule in quiz settings
- **Configurable defaults:** Set whether the rule is enabled by default for new quizzes

### Localization
- English and German translations included
- Full AMOS translation toolkit support

## Usage

### For Quiz Creators / Teachers

#### Enabling the Rule
1.  Edit your quiz settings
2.  Expand the **"Extra restrictions on attempts"** section
3.  Check the box for **"Block concurrent connections"**
4.  Save the quiz

**Note:** If you don't see this option, you may need the `quizaccess/oneconnection:editenabled` capability.

#### Managing Connection Changes During Exams

When students need to switch devices (e.g., technical issues, computer restart, exam room change):

1.  Navigate to the quiz
2.  Click the **"Results"** tab
3.  Select **"Allow connection changes"** from the dropdown menu

On the management page you can:

**Individual unlock:**
- Click the **"Allow change"** link next to a student's name

**Bulk unlock:**
- Check the boxes next to multiple students
- Click **"Allow change in connection for selected attempts"** at the bottom
- Useful for exam room technical issues affecting multiple students

**Filter and search:**
- Use the **"Attempts from"** filter to show only enrolled users or those with active attempts
- Use the **"Attempts that are"** filter to show specific attempt states (in progress, finished, etc.)
- Click initials to quickly jump to students by last name

**Audit and export:**
- View the **"Change allowed"** column to see who authorized changes and when
- Export the current view as CSV or Excel for record-keeping

**Important notes:**
- Connection changes can only be allowed for attempts in "In progress" state
- Changes can be granted proactively (before a student switches devices)
- All unlock actions are permanently logged for compliance and auditing
- When a change is allowed, the previous connection is blocked (only one active connection per attempt)

### For Students

When the rule is active and you try to continue your quiz from a different device/browser, you'll see a message indicating the attempt is blocked. Contact your exam invigilator or teacher to request a connection change.

## Configuration
